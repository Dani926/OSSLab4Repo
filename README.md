# PlannerLib
 PlannerLib is a free and open source application that comes with useful tools to integrate calendars and planners into any project. PlannerLib can be used as a standalone planner app, but its real strength is in how easily it can be modified for personal needs or added to a larger project.
 
 ## Business Model
 This project uses a dual-licensing business model supplemented by provided services. Casual users can install basic PlannerLib for free, and if they need help modifying it to suit their needs, our team is able to provide technical support for a small fee (though ideally the community will be able to help with most problems for free). Developers or companies who want to make PlannerLib part of their project must either comply with the restrictive copyleft terms of the LGPLv2, or choose to purchase PlannerLib+ under a commercial license. Not only are these clients purchasing a more feature-rich version of PlannerLib, they are also able to use it in proprietary software. 
 
 ## Choice of Licenses
 The basic version of PlannerLib is provided under the LGPL for multiple reasons. One important reason to incentivize purchasing PlannerLib+, since copyleft licenses are restrictive. I chose LGPL instead of GPL because this project satisfies the "special circumstances" mentioned on the GNU website -- namely that it's a library in a domain that already has plenty of competitors. The hope is that PlannerLib will be accessible for the casual user to develop a good reputation, and this reputation will lead to companies being willing to play for the product.
